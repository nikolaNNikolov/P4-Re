# P4-Re
A recreation of major features of Persona 4 in the Unity Engine. 
This is an entirely fan-made project with no intents of profit. It is created with the intent to show my ability to work with the Unity Engine.
So far, version 20210523 - V0.1 showcases the dialogue feature, alongside different types of UI, that can be seen in the original game, including regular UI, dungeon UI, battle UI and some of the menu UI, all of which are still WIP.

The models of the characters are taken from the game 'Persona 4 Dancing All Night' and character portraits and character backgrounds are taken from the game 'Persona 4 Arena'. All other UI sprites are either recreated, using references from the original Persona 4 or are heavily influenced by it.
